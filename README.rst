Asterion
########

Fit acoustic glitches present in the radial mode frequencies of solar-like oscillators.

.. warning::
    
    This package is in early development, expect frequent changes to functionality!

Do you have some asteroseismic mode frequencies for a particular star? Do you want to fit a model to those modes?
You need not look any further because this is the Python package for you. With this package you can fit a model
of the glitch in mode frequencies caused by the helium-II ionisation zone and base of the convective zone in the
stellar envelope. This model yields posterior estimates for the amplitudes of these glitches, which you can 
use to study surface helium content [references].

.. installation_label
Installation
============

To install, run one of the following.

Latest
------

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install git+https://github.com/alexlyttle/asterion@main#egg=asterion

Stable
------

An official release on PyPI for this package is coming soon...

.. getting_started_label
Getting started
===============

Before you start, make sure you have all of the required inputs and any of the optional inputs.

Required Inputs
---------------

* Radial (l=0) mode frequencies, :math:`\nu`
* Frequency of maximum power, :math:`\nu_\max`, and its uncertainty
* Large frequency separation, :math:`\Delta\nu`, and its uncertainty

Optional Inputs
---------------

* Uncertainty on the mode frequencies, :math:`\sigma_\nu`
* Effective temperature of the star, :math:`T_\mathrm{eff}`
* Asymptotic frequency offset/phase, :math:`\epsilon`, and its uncertainty

Example
-------

Firstly, define your inputs, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Location and scale of a normal distribution
    nu_max = (2357.69, 25.0)
    delta_nu = (111.84, 0.1)
    teff = (5000.0, 200.0)

    n = [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
    nu = [1601.25, 1712.38, 1822.87, 1932.24,
          2042.3 , 2153.48, 2265.2 , 2377.14,
          2488.87, 2601.02, 2713.51, 2826.4 ,
          2939.56, 3052.67]
    nu_err = 0.01  # Can be a scalar or a value for each nu

Then, import Asterion and create the model.

.. code-block:: python

    from asterion import GlitchModel

    model = GlitchModel(n, nu_max, delta_nu, teff=teff)

Start inference. It is good practice to inspect the prior predictive check that it is sensible.

.. code-block:: python

    from asterion import Inference

    infer = Inference(model, nu, nu_err=nu_err, seed=10)
    infer.prior_predictive()  # <-- check prior is sensible
    prior_data = infer.get_data()
    ...  # <-- inspect prior data with e.g. asterion.plot_glitch (see below)

Once you are happy with the prior, sample from the posterior and inspect the posterior predictive.

.. code-block:: python

    # Sample from the posterior
    infer.sample()
    infer.posterior_predictive()

    # Save inference data
    data = infer.get_data()
    data.to_netcdf('results.nc')  # save inference data as NETCDF

You can use Asterion to make plots with the data and summarise in your favourite format (so long as it's either Pandas or Astropy). You can load the data and make plots and summaries any time using Arviz.

.. code-block:: python

    import asterion as ast
    import arviz as az  # <-- for loading the inference data
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    data = az.from_netcdf('results.nc')  # <-- if loading the data elsewhere

    # Make plots to check posterior is sensible
    ast.plot_glitch(data, kind='He')
    ast.plot_glitch(data, kind='CZ')
    # E.g. a corner plot of the helium glitch parameters
    ast.plot_corner(data, var_names=['log_a_he', 'log_b_he', 'log_tau_he', 'phi_he'])

    # Save summary of results
    # Here all 0-dimensional parameters are saved in Astropy's
    # ECSV format which preserved data types and units
    table = ast.get_table(data, dims=(), fmt='astropy')
    table.write('data/summary.ecsv', overwrite=True)

    plt.show()

Check out the tutorials for more in-depth examples.

Notes
-----

* Variable names with the prefix :code:`'log_'` are base-10 logarithmic
* The :code:`seed` argument in :code:`GlitchModel` is used to sample from the prior on :math:`\tau` and should not affect inference.
* The :code:`seed` argument in :code:`Inference` is used for reproducibility and should not affect inference, but it is recommend you confirm this for yourself.
