  abstract = {In the present paper, we aim to constrain the properties of the ionisation region in a star from the oscillation frequency variation (a so-called glitch) caused by rapid structural variations in this very region. In particular, we seek to avoid the use of calibration based on stellar models thus providing a truly independent estimate of these properties. These include both the helium abundance and other physical quantities that can have a significant impact on the oscillation frequencies such as the electronic degeneracy parameter or the extent of the ionisation region. Taking as a starting point our first paper, we applied structural perturbations of the ionisation zone to the wave equation for radial oscillations in an isentropic region. The resulting glitch model is thus able to exploit the information contained in the fast frequency oscillation caused by the helium ionisation but also in the slow trend accompanying that of hydrogen. This information can directly be expressed in terms of parameters related respectively to the helium abundance, electronic degeneracy and extent of the ionisation region. Using a Bayesian inference, we show that a substantial recovery of the properties at the origin of the glitch is possible. A degeneracy between the helium abundance and the electronic degeneracy is found to exist, which particularly affects the helium estimate. Extending the method to cases where the glitch is subject to contamination (e.g. surface effects), we noted the importance of the slow glitch trend associated with hydrogen ionisation. We propose using a Gaussian process to disentangle the frequency glitch from surface effects.},

  abstract = {We investigate the influence of the ionization of helium on the low-degree acoustic oscillation frequencies in model solar-type stars. The signature in the oscillation frequencies characterizing the ionization-induced depression of the first adiabatic exponent {$\gamma$} is a superposition of two decaying periodic functions of frequency {$\nu$}, with `frequencies' that are approximately twice the acoustic depths of the centres of the HeI and HeII ionization regions. That variation is probably best exhibited in the second frequency difference {$\Delta$}2{$\nu$}n,l {$\equiv$} {$\nu$}n-1,l - 2{$\nu$}n,l + {$\nu$}n+1,l. We show how an analytic approximation to the variation of {$\gamma$} leads to a simple representation of this oscillatory contribution to {$\Delta$}2{$\nu$} which can be used to characterize the {$\gamma$} variation, our intention being to use it as a seismic diagnostic of the helium abundance of the star. We emphasize that the objective is to characterize {$\gamma$}, not merely to find a formula for {$\Delta$}2{$\nu$} that reproduces the data.},

Here we analyze a sample of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars showing solar-like oscillations as part of the Kepler seismic LEGACY project. We use Kepler short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star, we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ``peak-bagging'' approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}{$\nu$} and {$\delta$} \{{$\nu$} \}02; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at \{{$\nu$} \}\textbackslash max with \{T\}\{eff\}, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.},

  abstract = {With recent advances in modelling stars using high-precision asteroseismology, the systematic effects associated with our assumptions of stellar helium abundance (Y) and the mixing-length theory parameter ({$\alpha$}MLT) are becoming more important. We apply a new method to improve the inference of stellar parameters for a sample of Kepler dwarfs and subgiants across a narrow mass range (\$0.8 M 1.2\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$). In this method, we include a statistical treatment of Y and the {$\alpha$}MLT. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model to encode information about the distribution of Y and {$\alpha$}MLT in the population, fitting a linear helium enrichment law including an intrinsic spread around this relation and normal distribution in {$\alpha$}MLT. We test various levels of pooling parameters, with and without solar data as a calibrator. When including the Sun as a star, we find the gradient for the enrichment law, \$\textbackslash Delta Y / \textbackslash Delta Z = 1.05\textbackslash substack\{+0.28\textbackslash -0.25\}\$ and the mean {$\alpha$}MLT in the population, \$\textbackslash mu \_\textbackslash alpha = 1.90\textbackslash substack\{+0.10\textbackslash -0.09\}\$. While accounting for the uncertainty in Y and {$\alpha$}MLT, we are still able to report statistical uncertainties of 2.5 per cent in mass, 1.2 per cent in radius, and 12 per cent in age. Our method can also be applied to larger samples that will lead to improved constraints on both the population level inference and the star-by-star fundamental parameters.},

So far the process of performing an asteroseismic analysis of a star has remained somewhat esoteric and inaccessible to nonexperts. In this software paper we describe PBjam, an open-source Python package for analyzing the frequency spectra of solar-like oscillators in a simple but principled and automated way. The aim of PBjam is to provide a set of easy-to-use tools to extract information about the radial and quadropole oscillations in stars that oscillate like the Sun, which may then be used to infer bulk properties such as stellar mass, radius, age, or even structure. Asteroseismology and its data analysis methods are becoming increasingly important as space-based photometric observatories are producing a wealth of new data, allowing asteroseismology to be applied in a wide range of contexts such as exoplanet, stellar structure and evolution, and Galactic population studies.  * Release 1.0.0 Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.4300079.},

  abstract = {Solar activity has significantly changed over the last two Schwabe cycles. After a long and deep minimum at the end of Cycle 23, the weaker activity of Cycle 24 contrasts with the previous cycles. In this work, the response of the solar acoustic oscillations to solar activity is used in order to provide insights into the structural and magnetic changes in the sub-surface layers of the Sun during this on-going unusual period of low activity. We analyze 18 yr of continuous observations of the solar acoustic oscillations collected by the Sun-as-a-star GOLF instrument on board the SoHO spacecraft. From the fitted mode frequencies, the temporal variability of the frequency shifts of the radial, dipolar, and quadrupolar modes are studied for different frequency ranges that are sensitive to different layers in the solar sub-surface interior. The low-frequency modes show nearly unchanged frequency shifts between Cycles 23 and 24, with a time evolving signature of the quasi-biennial oscillation, which is particularly visible for the quadrupole component revealing the presence of a complex magnetic structure. The modes at higher frequencies show frequency shifts that are 30\% smaller during Cycle 24, which is in agreement with the decrease observed in the surface activity between Cycles 23 and 24. The analysis of 18 yr of GOLF oscillations indicates that the structural and magnetic changes responsible for the frequency shifts remained comparable between Cycle 23 and Cycle 24 in the deeper sub-surface layers below 1400 km as revealed by the low-frequency modes. The frequency shifts of the higher-frequency modes, sensitive to shallower regions, show that Cycle 24 is magnetically weaker in the upper layers of Sun. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendices are available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201425236/olm"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}The following 68 GOLF frequency tables are available and Table A.1 is also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{$<$}/A{$>$} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/578/A137"{$>$}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/578/A137{$<$}/A{$>$}},

For this we use the fact that the helium ionization zone leaves a signature on the oscillation frequencies and that this signature can be calibrated to determine the helium abundance of that layer. By calibrating the signature of the helium ionization zone against models of known helium abundance, the helium abundance in the envelope of 16 Cyg A is found to lie in the range of 0.231 to 0.251 and that of 16 Cyg B lies in the range of 0.218 to 0.266.},
