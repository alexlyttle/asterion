  abstract = {The advent of space-based missions like Kepler has revolutionized the  study of solar-type stars, particularly through the measurement and modeling of their resonant modes of oscillation. Here we analyze a sample of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars showing solar-like oscillations as part of the Kepler seismic LEGACY project. We use Kepler short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star, we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ``peak-bagging'' approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}{$\nu$} and {$\delta$} \{{$\nu$} \}02; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at \{{$\nu$} \}\textbackslash max with \{T\}\{eff\}, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.},

  abstract = {16 Cyg A and B are among the brightest stars observed by Kepler. What makes these stars more interesting is that they are solar analogs. 16 Cyg A and B exhibit solar-like oscillations. In this work we use oscillation frequencies obtained using 2.5 yr of Kepler data to determine the current helium abundance of these stars. For this we use the fact that the helium ionization zone leaves a signature on the oscillation frequencies and that this signature can be calibrated to determine the helium abundance of that layer. By calibrating the signature of the helium ionization zone against models of known helium abundance, the helium abundance in the envelope of 16 Cyg A is found to lie in the range of 0.231 to 0.251 and that of 16 Cyg B lies in the range of 0.218 to 0.266.},
